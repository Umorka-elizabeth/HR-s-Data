 ### Datalysis and Insights Generation
 This visualization reveals total numbers of employees, current employees and attrition number and rate. It also features attrition in their various categories.
 
 - Attrition number rate is 16% (237 numbers) of the entire number of 1470 employees in the company and it cut across the departments, gender and age band as shown by the cards and other visualizations.
  
 - Research and development has the highest attrition number, followed by Sales and HR department reporting 56%, 39% and 5% respectively. In the educational field, Life sciences has the highest number of 89 attrition and the Human resource has the lowest number of 7 attrition as shown by the donut chart and barchart.

 - The male gender has 63% of the attrition with a number of 150 while the female gender has 87 numbers representing 37% of the total attrition number.

 - From the table age band, this reveals that age band 25-34 has the highest attrition number of 112, followed by age band 35-44, under 25, 45-54 and over 55 with a corresponding number of 51, 38, 25 and 11 respectively.


### Recommendation
---
1. The company should be more friendly and create enabling environment for her employees to avoid attrition especially among the age-band 25-34 which can be classified as vibrant employees going by their age.
   
2. Employees love motivation and incentive, the HR department should invest more in this area, for example, monthly, quarterly and yearly recognition of employees top performance etc
   
3. Salaries to be reviewed by HR department which might be one of the reasons for attrition.
   
4. A questionnaire about employees behaviour and their observations be passed across for them to fill. This will provide some insights about attrition.
   
5. More strategies to be adopted by the HR department in relation to employees workflow in the office in other to avoid or reduce retention rate to the bearest minimum. 
   

### Conclusion
---
The attrition rate as analysed is alarming and there is need for urgent solution to bring the number to an reasonable level. If the HR department will engage in activities relating to employees welfare, development and satisfaction in addition to the above recommendations, Attrition rate will fall below 16% and the company will enjoy a lasting relationship with her employees.
